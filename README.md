## Recommendations 

### Potential New Offering - Real-Time Feedback Solution for Healthcare Providers

In response to the challenges posed by claims rejections and denials, Akasa is encouraged to explore the development of a real-time feedback solution for healthcare providers. Leveraging its existing technologies, including *Unified Automation*® powered by computer vision-based RPA, modern AI, and ML, Akasa can extend its capabilities to offer targeted feedback to providers. This solution would specifically address services commonly resulting in claims rejections or denials due to non-compliance with Local Coverage Determinations (LCDs) and payer reimbursement policies relevant to specific services. 

By incorporating real-time feedback into its suite of services, Akasa would be able to help providers enhance documentation practices, ensuring that claims meet the intricate requirements set by payers. This innovative approach aligns with Akasa's commitment to continuous improvement and efficiency in revenue cycle management. This proactive approach would aim to improve the transmission of clean claims, thereby reducing the likelihood of denials. Addressing the root cause of claim rejections through targeted feedback could significantly impact the percentage of denials, subsequently leading to positive effects on Days in Accounts Receivable (DSO) and cash yield per claim. 

The real-time feedback loop provides a mechanism for continuous improvement, fostering collaboration between Akasa and healthcare providers to navigate the complexities of revenue cycle management successfully. 

To enhance the impact of the real-time feedback solution, Akasa is advised to integrate it seamlessly into existing EMR platforms. The utilization of Akasa's existing technologies underscores the adaptability and scalability of Akasa's solutions, offering a seamless integration of the new service to benefit both providers and the healthcare ecosystem. The incorporation of the new service within built-in remediation queues, akin to a help menu, would provide a user-friendly experience for healthcare providers. This approach would ensure that the feedback system becomes an integral part of the provider's workflow, offering guidance and assistance at the point of care. 

By overlaying the real-time feedback solution on EMR platforms, Akasa can streamline the user experience, making it easily accessible and actionable for providers. The goal is to empower healthcare professionals with instant insights into documentation practices, thereby mitigating issues that lead to claim rejections. This user-centric approach aligns with Akasa's commitment to enhancing operational efficiency and promoting collaborative solutions within the healthcare landscape.
